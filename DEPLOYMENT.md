# Deployment Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: This project is hosted on GitHub Pages and is served from the **`gh-pages`** branch.

## How to Deploy

1.  Make your changes and commit them to `main` (or your feature branch).
2.  **Push the changes to `gh-pages` to trigger a deployment.**

```bash
# Push main to gh-pages
git push origin main:gh-pages
```

**Do NOT just push to `main` and expect the site to update.** The live site does NOT track the `main` branch.

## Verification
- URL: http://www.a2z-ventures.com/Gym/
- Updates typically take 1-5 minutes to appear.
- If updates are stuck, check the Actions tab in GitHub repository to see if the pages build failed.
